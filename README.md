# Project made using React + TypeScript + Vite

- The project is hosted in [Vercel](https://gest-in.vercel.app/)

- For now you can run it localy by running the following code in `git bash`:

First clone the repo
```js
git clone https://github.com/Hartye/gest-in
```

Enter the folder and run the following
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

A `localhost` server is to appear so you just need to put that url in your browser
